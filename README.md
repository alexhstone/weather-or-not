Weather or not is an app designed around a pun. My goal with this project is to take something a bit mundane (a very simple weather app) and see how interesting I can make it over time.  


The current build of the app gives you the weather in a few cities.  

and not the weather... in those cities. 

This app utilizes the open-meteo weather API, for which, the documentation can be found here: 
https://open-meteo.com/en/docs#api_form

I'll be adding a bit more functionality (and silliness) to this app as time goes on
I just thought it'd be nice to have a bit of javascript on my github page in the meantime :)
